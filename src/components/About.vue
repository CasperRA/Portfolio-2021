      <p>
        As a Multimediadesigner I've had a lot of different projects, requiring
        different skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through teamwork and dedication I've learnt to build complicated
        websites and be quick to adapt to new libraries, frameworks & packages.
        <br />
        <br />
        Being on top of new technology helps me grow with the industry and be
        able to take on new tasks, out of my comfort zone.
